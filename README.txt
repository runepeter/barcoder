== Barcoder ==

Barcoder is a Web application that will generate QR-barcodes that
encodes a URL, which you provide. It is based on jQuery on the 
Web-side, Jersey REST on the server side and Mule on the processing
back-end.

This application depends on http://github.com/runepeter/mule-ranger-pack

Enjoy!
